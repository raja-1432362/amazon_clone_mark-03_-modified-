In this repository, I've developed an Amazon clone with enhancements over the previous version, incorporating JavaScript to deliver a smoother and more interactive user experience.

# Amazon Clone - Responsive E-commerce Website

This is a fully responsive front-end clone of the Amazon India homepage. The project is built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS** — no frameworks or external CSS files. The goal of this project is to replicate Amazon’s visual design while practicing clean HTML structure, responsive CSS layout techniques, and simple CSS animations.

## Project Overview

The website consists of several key sections, including:

- A **responsive navbar** with logo, delivery address, search bar, language dropdown, sign-in options, and a cart icon.
- A **sliding hero banner** showcasing promotional content with CSS keyframe animation.
- A **horizontal navigation panel** for category shortcuts.
- A **category grid section** featuring themed product categories with image cards and hover effects.
- A **deals section** showcasing featured products with ratings, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- A **brand highlights section** displaying products from major brands.
- A **footer** with multiple columns and a back-to-top button.

The design is responsive and adjusts gracefully across screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
